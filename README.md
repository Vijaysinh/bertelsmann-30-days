Milestones:
1. Hurrah! The documentation for our Lunar Segmentation project has been finished. You can look at the result [here](https://github.com/anvillasoto/lunar-segmentation-openvino). 
2. I am on the process on deploying this on Node server with MQTT enabled on a live server. Probably Elastic Beanstalk is way to go instead of provisioning EC2 instance. I do not need that level of control for the meantime.

D14:
----------

Milestones:
1. I am currently preparing for the documentation for our LunarX project. Mind you, the pipelined approch for pulling this off using what we learned so far in the Cloud DevOps using AWS Lambda is tricky. But at least we keep our models and our results intact in the process.
2. Still stuck on what I previously learned in the cloud fundamentals section of the course. Will continue it tomorrow since it is holiday in the Philippines and I would have ample time continuing to where I left.

Milestones:
1. Ok. So I finished working on my Lunar Segmentation project using OpenVINO. After hours of tinkering, I finally figured out how to make the Model Optimizer work. Thiis is not much but this is my output.

2. In between my model training, I continue on the cloud fundamentals course. This is more of a perusal on my end. I will make sure everything will be in place very soon.

D11:
----------

Milestones:
1. Now, I am exploring text detection pipeline for my personal project. Unlike Google Cloud Vision, it is not straightforward as you need to poll if Textract has finished analyzing the document. Will solve this later.
2. Continued with the cloud fundamentals course. 
3. Finished challenge 19-20 of the #testyourgit challenge. So far so good!
